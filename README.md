## Honey Sting/Stang (Elevator Pitch) ❥

People are often frustrated by the effort it takes to express their voice in a free and safe zone where they can be heard.
Our App eliminates the feeling of being imprisoned without a voice.
For years, people have trusted society to safe guard freedom of expression however time and time again they have found themselves.. their.. voice restricted.
With voiceS, you can express yourself freely and bring about creative freedom on a platform that not only values your voice but broadcasts it, with the power of community.
